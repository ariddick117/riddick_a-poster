# Interactive Infographic

The basis of this assignment is to take complex information – statistics, research results, data comparison, forms, charts, analysis, etc., – and present it in the most efficient and easily understood way possible. The specific difference between this form of design and traditional infographics is the dynamic nature of the interactive information design. In this context the complexity of information can parse both live and static content from a variety of sources with real-time results. This data could be drawn from data bases, user inputs, algorithms, etc.,

## Description

My infographic uses the vast character roster from the video game Overwatch. Designed by Blizzard Entertainment, Overwatch has an ever expanding list of heroes that each have a unique playstyle, weapons, abilities, and ultimates. No two characters play the same way and when they interact on the battlefield, it can be helpful to know who is a strong matchup against who. 

For example, if a Junkrat is on the enemy team, they are usually used for asset-denial as they can set traps and bombs to prevent your team from getting to a point to capture it. A counter for that pesky Junkrat would be a Widowmaker as she has a sniper rifle and can pick him off from a distance. She can also use a grappnel to get above Junkrat which puts him at another disadvantage.

By using the recognizable hero icons, users can click one of the buttons below to display the icons that each hero is strong/weak against. This is much faster than googling the answers with the information all in one place.
